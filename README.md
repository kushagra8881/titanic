#Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression
Overview
This machine learning project utilizes logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including features like PassengerId, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked. Our goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Data Preparation: In this section, we perform data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA involves exploring the dataset to gain insights, visualize data distributions, and understand the relationships between variables. This step is crucial for feature selection and engineering.

Feature Engineering: We create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive performance. Feature engineering helps in capturing meaningful information from the data.

Model Development: We use logistic regression as the predictive model. Logistic regression is a suitable choice for binary classification problems like predicting survival (0 = not survived, 1 = survived). We train the model on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the logistic regression model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. These metrics help us assess how well the model predicts survival.

Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tune the logistic regression model by optimizing hyperparameters to improve its predictive performance.

Prediction: Once the model is trained and tuned, we use it to make predictions on a separate test dataset to assess its real-world performance.

Conclusion: We summarize the project, discuss the model's performance, and provide insights from the EDA and feature engineering stages.
